## Introduction

Title: The benefits of Matlab Campus-Wide license

- with a focus on AI and ML

## Online courses

- Mathworks portal: University has dedicated portal

- Courses homepage: [matlabacademy.mathworks.com](matlabacademy.mathworks.com)
  
  - OnRamp courses: 13 courses, 23 hours
    - prior to the first classroom lectures
    - don't waste time teach basics of syntax, use online course
    - Matlab, Simulink, AI, ML DL, RL Onramps
    - Signal Processing
  - InDepth: free for CWL, 13 courses, 100 hours

## Matlab Online

## Live Scripts
- include controls, like in Jupyter notebooks
- much less files in one project

- Matlab on mobile platforms (phone)
  - access sensors (e.g. step counter)

## Matlab Grader

- 90% of tests can be implemented online instead of paper & pen
- some effort:
  - clear description, form of solution
  - Latex based support
  - prepare template, piece of code with empty parts
  - prepare reference solution
  - MG compares student solution with reference sol
  - provide testing criteria
  - can add *.m files or *.p files
  - test types:
    - compare variable with correct result
    - matlab code for own testing
  - can be implemented in Moodle!

- It is possible to compare students' solutionsÂ among each other
- Can later modify come and evaluate them again
- Can export results in excel sheet format


## ML, DL, AI support

- supports entire workflow:
  - data preparation, generation, cleaning
  - AI modeling: design, tuning, train, compatib with TF and pytorch (yeah sure )
  - System design (simulink, simscape, validation)
  - Deployment & code generation

- Use DL Toolbox examples, courses

- Examples: 
  
  - Written character recognition

  - Classification Learner tool
    - many algorithms available

  - Transfer Learning with Deep Network Designer

    - built-in pretrain networks

  - Parallel computing support (`parfor`)
