## Xie2013: On A Nonlinear Generalization of Sparse Coding and Dictionary Learning

- > a novel framework for sparse coding and dictionary learning for data on a Riemannian manifold, and it shows that the existing sparse coding and dictionary learning methods can be considered as special (Euclidean) cases of the more general framework proposed here.

- > data and features are often presented as points on known Riemannian manifolds, e.g., the space of symmetric positive-definite matrices (Fletcher & Joshi, 2007), hyperspheres for parameterizing square-root densities (Srivastava et al., 2007), Stiefel and Grassmann manifolds (Mardia & Jupp, 1999), etc..

- Manifold-based sparse coding.

- Reformulates sparsity in affine way, reformulates sparse coding and dictionary learning

- Example: dictionary learning on the sphere

- Strongly mathematical
