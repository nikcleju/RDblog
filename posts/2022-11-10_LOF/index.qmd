LOF: identifying density-based local outliers\
ACM SIGMOD Record, 2000, 29, 93-104

## Comments:

- Outlier-ness is **not binary**, but is a **degree**: it is a number. 

- LOF = Local Outlier Factor = average density around nearest neighbors / density around point in question (sort of):
  - High LOF = more outlier
  - Low LOF (around 1) = not outlier, in cluster

- LOF score depends on the neighbourhoods of neigbors, adapts to "density" of neighboring clusters

- Me: Not clear how it scales to high dimensions, the intuitions might be wrong
