\textbf{Machine Learning for industrial applications: A comprehensive
literature review}

\(5/5 \star\)

\begin{quote}
Article (Bertolini2021)\\
Bertolini, M.; Mezzogori, D.; Neroni, M. \& Zammori, F.\\
Machine Learning for industrial applications: A comprehensive literature
review Expert Systems with Applications, 2021, 175, 114820
\end{quote}

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Good review paper, classifies papers by Application Domain and by ML
  algorithm.
\item
  Not only for CNC / machining, but many types of industrial
  applications
\item
  Large number of papers surveyed
\item
  Hot and not-so-hot topics, clustered:

  \begin{quote}
  Using these metrics, five main clusters can be identified. These are:

  \begin{enumerate}
  \def\labelenumi{\arabic{enumi}.}
  \tightlist
  \item
    \textbf{Question Marks (Low Age and Negative Trend)} -- Recently
    introduced topics, that have not got a follow-up, yet. Thermography
    (THER), Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Design For (D4) belong to
    this category.
  \item
    \textbf{Hot Topics (Low Age and \sout{Negative} Positive Trend)} --
    Very recent topics of booming interest. At present, none of the
    keywords properly belong to this category. Yet, Additive
    Manufacturing (ADD\_MN), Prediction \& Prognostic (PR\_PR), and
    Industry 4.0 (I4.0) are those who come closest to this category. For
    this reason, they have been labeled as `new promises'.
  \item
    \textbf{Consolidated (Medium Age and Stable Trend)} -- Not recent
    topics, which are still studied, but without the initial spike of
    interests. Topics such as Supply Chain Management (SCMI), Flexible
    Manufacturing Systems (FMS), Inventory Control (INV\_CTRI), and Tool
    Monitoring (TLL\_MN) belong to this category.
  \item
    \textbf{Stars (High Age and Positive Trend)} -- Old and consolidated
    topics that are still attracting increasing research interest.
    Topics such as Diagnosis and Fault Detection (DG\_FLT),
    Manufacturing Process (MN\_PR), Intelligent Manufacturing (INT\_MN),
    and Big Data analysis (BD\_DM) certainly belong to this class.
    Probably, Simulation (SIM) and the Internet of Things (IoT) are on
    their way to become stars.
  \item
    \textbf{Obsoletes (High Age and Negative Trend)} -- Old topics that
    have never received much scientific interest and that have almost
    disappeared from the technical literature. Due to the recent
    introduction of ML, for operation management, no keywords can be
    classified as obsoÂ­ letes yet. However, Order Management (OM) and,
    probably, also Feature Extraction (FT\_EX) are moving toward this
    class.

\item
  Maintenance management: keep assets and machines at a full operating
  state

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    Failure Mode Analysis: Faults detection and classification. Easily
    interpreted as a prediction task, where historical data are
    collected on the production floor, and faulty and non-faulty events
    are used as ground-truth data against which a prediction model can
    be trained (NN, SVM)
  \item
    Condition Monitoring: the most common applications concern condition
    monitoring of rotating mechanical systems and rolling bearings. The
    problem is solved using vibrations and/or acoustic signals as
    classifiers inputs.
  \item
    Downtime Minimization: Plan predictive maintainance operations
    smartly, to minimize costs.

    optimal sequence of technical steps, reduce electricity consumption,
    optimize parameters
  \item
    Scheduling: NP-hard, select dispatching rules, dynamic scheduling
    based on conditions
  \item
    Process Control: Reinforcement Learning to automate a process;
    optimizing parameters for safe behavior in non-conforming
    operations.
  \end{itemize}
\item

  Surface roughness classification, based on acoustic signals during
  cutting.
\item
  Use STFT followed by PCA per coefficients, and SVM for classification.

  Some complicated experimental machining setups, several parameters in
  the process (rotating speed, feed rate). The experimental setups
  depend on many factors.

  Idea:

  \begin{itemize}
  \tightlist
  \item
    In normal operation, model the cutting force / normal power
    consumption based on spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut with
    SVRegression (alternative: with multiple linear regression)
  \item
    Detection: if actual measured values deviate a lot from model
    predictions (by a threshold), we have a breakage.

\begin{itemize}
\item
  Nice introduction and review:

  \begin{itemize}
  \item
    \begin{quote}
    For the indirect method of tool condition monitoring, there are
    considerably numerous studies attempting to correlate the
    relationship between the machining parameters with tool wear
    \end{quote}
  \item
    tool wear detection with visual and non-visual signals (cutting
    force, sound, vibration)
  \item
    tool wear estimation by visually analyzing the surface of the
    machined part
  \end{itemize}
\item
  Ue a special type of NN, Wavelet Neural Network, to predict
  \textbf{flank wear}. WNN is just their quirk.
\item
  WNN are a generalized form of RBF-NN, with wavelet activation
  functions
\item
  Use images of the tool itself and/or the surface of the machined part
\item
  Image preprocessing of the worn region of the tool:

    Tuning the hyper-parameter Î², to a value larger than one, can enable

Conclusions:

\begin{quote}
\begin{itemize}
\tightlist
\item
  The largest unbalance could be detected by all algorithms with almost
  perfect prediction accuracy, even if only 3 characteristic values per
  sample were used for the classification.
\item
  With the smaller unbalances, on the other hand, wider variations
  between the different approaches were found.
\item
  The best way to classify the dataset was to use an FC network with two
  hidden layers, which received the scaled FFT-transformed vibration
  data as input.
\item
  Measured on the entire evaluation dataset, 98.6 \% of the cases could
  be classified correctly.

Vibration data was collected using accelerometers, which were attached
to the housing with magnetic bases. Accelerometers were placed at the 12
o'clock position at both the drive end and fan end of the motor housing.
During some experiments, an accelerometer was attached to the motor
supporting base plate as well. Vibration signals were collected using a
16 channel DAT recorder, and were post processed in a Matlab
environment. All data files are in Matlab (*.mat) format. Digital data
was collected at 12,000 samples per second, and data was also collected
at 48,000 samples per second for drive end bearing faults. Speed and
horsepower data were collected using the torque transducer/encoder and
were recorded by hand.

Four bearings were installed on a shaft. The rotation speed was kept
constant at 2000 RPM by an AC motor coupled to the shaft via rub belts.
A radial load of 6000 lbs is applied onto the shaft \textgreater{} and
bearing by a spring mechanism. All bearings are force lubricated.
Rexnord ZA-2115 double row bearings were installed on the shaft as shown
in Figure 1. PCB 353B33 High Sensitivity Quartz ICP accelerometers were
installed on the bearing housing (two accelerometers for each bearing
{[}x- and y-axes{]} for data set 1, one accelerometer for each bearing
for data sets 2 and 3). Sensor placement is also shown in Figure 1. All
failures occurred after exceeding designed life time of the bearing
which is more than 100 million revolutions.

This dataset contains vibration data recorded on a rotating drive train.
This drive train consists of an electronically commutated DC motor and a
shaft driven by it, which passes through a roller bearing. With the help
of a 3D-printed holder, unbalances with different weights and different
radii were attached to the shaft. Besides the strength of the
unbalances, the rotation speed of the motor was also varied. This
dataset can be used to develop and test algorithms for the automatic
detection of unbalances on drive trains. Datasets for 4 differently
sized unbalances and for the unbalance-free case were recorded. The
vibration data was recorded at a sampling rate of 4096 values per
second. Datasets for development (ID ``D{[}0-4{]}'') as well as for
evaluation (ID ``E{[}0-4{]}'') are available for each unbalance
strength. The rotation speed was varied between approx. 630 and 2330 RPM
in the development datasets and between approx. 1060 and 1900 RPM in the
evaluation datasets. For each measurement of the development dataset
there are approx. 107min of continuous measurement data available, for
each measurement of the evaluation dataset 28min. Details of the
recorded measurements and the used unbalance strengths are documented in
the README.md file
