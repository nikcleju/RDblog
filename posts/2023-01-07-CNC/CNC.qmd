## Review papers

### ($5\star$) Machine Learning for industrial applications: A comprehensive literature review [@Bertolini2021]

> Article (Bertolini2021)
> Bertolini, M.; Mezzogori, D.; Neroni, M. & Zammori, F.

> Expert Systems with Applications, 2021, 175, 114820 

- Good review paper, classifies papers by Application Domain and by ML algorithm.
- Not only for CNC / machining, but many types of industrial applications
- Large number of papers surveyed

- Hot and not-so-hot topics, clustered:

  >    Using these metrics, five main clusters can be identified. These are:
      1. **Question Marks (Low Age and Negative Trend)** – Recently introduced
      topics, that have not got a follow-up, yet. Thermography (THER),
      Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Design For (D4) belong to this
      category.
      2. **Hot Topics (Low Age and ~~Negative~~ Positive Trend)** – Very recent topics of
      booming interest. At present, none of the keywords properly belong
      to this category. Yet, Additive Manufacturing (ADD_MN), Prediction
      & Prognostic (PR_PR), and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) are those who come
      closest to this category. For this reason, they have been labeled as
      ‘new promises’.
      3. **Consolidated (Medium Age and Stable Trend)** – Not recent topics,
      which are still studied, but without the initial spike of interests.
      Topics such as Supply Chain Management (SCMI), Flexible
      Manufacturing Systems (FMS), Inventory Control (INV_CTRI), and
      Tool Monitoring (TLL_MN) belong to this category.
      4. **Stars (High Age and Positive Trend)** – Old and consolidated topics
      that are still attracting increasing research interest. Topics such as
      Diagnosis and Fault Detection (DG_FLT), Manufacturing Process
      (MN_PR), Intelligent Manufacturing (INT_MN), and Big Data analysis
      (BD_DM) certainly belong to this class. Probably, Simulation (SIM)
      and the Internet of Things (IoT) are on their way to become stars.
      5. **Obsoletes (High Age and Negative Trend)** – Old topics that have never
      received much scientific interest and that have almost disappeared
      from the technical literature. Due to the recent introduction of ML,
      for operation management, no keywords can be classified as obso­
      letes yet. However, Order Management (OM) and, probably, also
      Feature Extraction (FT_EX) are moving toward this class.

#### Interesting aspects

1. Maintenance management: keep assets and machines at a full operating state
   - Failure Mode Analysis: Faults detection and classification.
   Easily interpreted as a prediction task, where historical data are collected on the
   production floor, and faulty and non-faulty events are used as ground-truth data against which a prediction model can be trained (NN, SVM)
   - Condition Monitoring: the most common applications concern condition monitoring of rotating mechanical systems and rolling bearings.
   The problem is solved using vibrations and/or acoustic signals as classifiers inputs.
   - Downtime Minimization: Plan predictive maintainance operations smartly, to minimize costs.

2. Quality Management
   - Defects' Detection and Classification
     - Unbalanced datasets
   - Visual quality inspection: detect defects by image classification

3. Production Planning & Control (PPC)
   - Performance Prediction and Optimization: order acceptance policy, optimal sequence of technical steps, reduce electricity consumption, optimize parameters
   - Scheduling: NP-hard, select dispatching rules, dynamic scheduling based on conditions
   - Process Control: Reinforcement Learning to automate a process; optimizing parameters for safe behavior in non-conforming operations.

4. Supply Chain Management: logistics
   - Modeling and Coordination: Reinforcement Learning
   - Demand Forecasts: prediction models
   - Inventory Control:  
   - complex modeling of supply chains, not easy, RL is a good fit here

Other things:
- noisy data is common, many techniques used to clean it
- unbalanced data
- low interpretability, with Deep NNs

### ($3\star$) Smart Machining Process Using Machine Learning: A Review and Perspective on Machining Industry (2018) [@Kim2018_SmartMachineReview]

Contains a listing of many machining problems where machine learning algorithms have been used in machining.

- Machine processes: General, milling, drilling
- Purpose: Tool wear and breakage, predict energy consumption, surface roughness prediction, process parameter optimization
- Algorithms: SVM and SVR, various NNs, Random forests, linear regression,  k-NN, depending on task

### ($2\star$) Data Driven Cutting Tool Fault Diagnosis System Using Machine Learning Approach: A Review [@Tambake2021]

## Technical papers

### Wear Characterization of the Cutting Tool in Milling Processes using Shape and Texture Descriptors (PhD thesis, 2017)[@Ordas2017_WearCharactPhD] 

- PhD thesis which proposes and evaluates some image-based descriptors to characterize tool wear, using a cheap Raspberry Pi + camera setup which captures images of the cutting tool.

- Investigative / no remarkable results.

### Surface roughness diagnosis in hard turning using acoustic signals and support vector machine: A PCA-based approach [@Papandrea2020]

- Surface roughness classification, based on acoustic signals during cutting. 
- Use STFT followed by PCA per coefficients, and SVM for classification.
- Tested on CNC, with stock microphone
- Some complicated experimental machining setups, several parameters in the process (rotating speed, feed rate). The experimental setups depend on many factors.
- Results weak. Some PCA coeffs are correlated with roughness, and can be clustered consistently into 3 groups, which can then be identified in test sets.
- More investigative / basic research, no remarkable results.

### Tool breakage detection using support vector machine learning in a milling process [@Cho2005]

> Article (Cho2005)
> Cho, S.; Asfour, S.; Onar, A. & Kaundinya, N.
> Tool breakage detection using support vector machine learning in a milling process
> International Journal of Machine Tools and Manufacture, 2005, 45, 241-249

- Detect two types of tool breakage: shank breakage and flute breakage
- Cutting forces + power consumption (proportional with force) + SVRegression => detect flute breakage
- Idea:
  - In normal operation, model the cutting force / normal power consumption based on spindle speed, feed rate, depth of cut with SVRegression (alternative: with multiple linear regression)
  - Detection: if actual measured values deviate a lot from model predictions (by a threshold), we have a breakage.
- SVR is hard to parameterize!

## Datasets

### CRWU Bearing Dataset

> Vibration data was collected using accelerometers, which were attached to the housing with magnetic bases. Accelerometers were placed at the 12 o’clock position at both the drive end and fan end of the motor housing. During some experiments, an accelerometer was attached to the motor supporting base plate as well. Vibration signals were collected using a 16 channel DAT recorder, and were post processed in a Matlab environment. All data files are in Matlab (*.mat) format. Digital data was collected at 12,000 samples per second, and data was also collected at 48,000 samples per second for drive end bearing faults. Speed and horsepower data were collected using the torque transducer/encoder and were recorded by hand.
