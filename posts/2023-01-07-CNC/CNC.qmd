A review of papers on ML / AI approaches in machining and CNC

## Review papers

### ($3\star$) Smart Machining Process Using Machine Learning: A Review and Perspective on Machining Industry (2018) [@Kim2018_SmartMachineReview]
    
Contains a listing of many machining problems where machine learning algorithms have been used in machining.
    
- Machine processes: General, milling, drilling
- Purpose: Tool wear and breakage, predict energy consumption, surface roughness prediction, process parameter optimization
- Algorithms: SVM and SVR, various NNs, Random forests, linear regression,  k-NN, depending on task

### ($2\star$) Data Driven Cutting Tool Fault Diagnosis System Using Machine Learning Approach: A Review [@Tambake2021]

- Poorly written, but contains a list of papers on fault detection

### ($5\star$) Machine Learning for industrial applications: A comprehensive literature review [@Bertolini2021]

- Good review paper, classifies papers by Application Domain and by ML algorithm.
- Not only for CNC / machining, but many types of industrial applications
- Large number of papare surveyed
- To come back later

- Hot and not-so-hot topics, clustered:

  >    Using these metrics, five main clusters can be identified. These are:
      1. **Question Marks (Low Age and Negative Trend)** – Recently introduced
      topics, that have not got a follow-up, yet. Thermography (THER),
      Cyber-Physical Systems (CPS), and Design For (D4) belong to this
      category.
      2. **Hot Topics (Low Age and ~~Negative~~ Positive Trend)** – Very recent topics of
      booming interest. At present, none of the keywords properly belong
      to this category. Yet, Additive Manufacturing (ADD_MN), Prediction
      & Prognostic (PR_PR), and Industry 4.0 (I4.0) are those who come
      closest to this category. For this reason, they have been labeled as
      ‘new promises’.
      3. **Consolidated (Medium Age and Stable Trend)** – Not recent topics,
      which are still studied, but without the initial spike of interests.
      Topics such as Supply Chain Management (SCMI), Flexible
      Manufacturing Systems (FMS), Inventory Control (INV_CTRI), and
      Tool Monitoring (TLL_MN) belong to this category.
      4. **Stars (High Age and Positive Trend)** – Old and consolidated topics
      that are still attracting increasing research interest. Topics such as
      Diagnosis and Fault Detection (DG_FLT), Manufacturing Process
      (MN_PR), Intelligent Manufacturing (INT_MN), and Big Data analysis
      (BD_DM) certainly belong to this class. Probably, Simulation (SIM)
      and the Internet of Things (IoT) are on their way to become stars.
      5. **Obsoletes (High Age and Negative Trend)** – Old topics that have never
      received much scientific interest and that have almost disappeared
      from the technical literature. Due to the recent introduction of ML,
      for operation management, no keywords can be classified as obso­
      letes yet. However, Order Management (OM) and, probably, also
      Feature Extraction (FT_EX) are moving toward this class.

## Technical papers

### Wear Characterization of the Cutting Tool in Milling Processes using Shape and Texture Descriptors (PhD thesis, 2017)[@Ordas2017_WearCharactPhD] 

- PhD thesis which proposes and evaluates some image-based descriptors to characterize tool wear, using a cheap Raspberry Pi + camera setup which captures images of the cutting tool.

- Investigative / no remarkable results.

### Surface roughness diagnosis in hard turning using acoustic signals and support vector machine: A PCA-based approach [@Papandrea2020]

- Surface roughness classification, based on acoustic signals during cutting. 
- Use STFT followed by PCA per coefficients, and SVM for classification.
- Tested on CNC, with stock microphone
- Some complicated experimental machining setups, several parameters in the process (rotating speed, feed rate). The experimental setups depend on many factors.
- Results weak. Some PCA coeffs are correlated with roughness, and can be clustered consistently into 3 groups, which can then be identified in test sets.
- More investigative / basic research, no remarkable results.
