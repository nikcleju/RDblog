  abstract   = {The Fourth Industrial Revolution incorporates the digital revolution into the physical world, creating a new direction in a number of fields, including artificial intelligence, quantum computing, nanotechnology, biotechnology, robotics, 3D printing, autonomous vehicles, and the Internet of Things. The artificial intelligence field has encountered a turning point mainly due to advancements in machine learning, which allows machines to learn, improve, and perform a specific task through data without being explicitly programmed. Machine learning can be utilized with machining processes to improve product quality levels and productivity rates, to monitor the health of systems, and to optimize design and process parameters. This is known as smart machining, referring to a new machining paradigm in which machine tools are fully connected through a cyber-physical system. This paper reviews and summarizes machining processes using machine learning algorithms and suggests a perspective on the machining industry.},

  abstract  = {Evaluación del desgaste de plaquitas de herramientas de corte mediante técnicas de visión artificial = This thesis proposes several methods to evaluate the wear level of tools in milling processes. Using shape descriptors based on contour, moments and orientations, and also texture ones, the wear regions of the cutting inserts were characterised and using different classifiers the wear was modelled. The proposed models were evaluated on classic shape datasets as well as in new insert datasets created specifically for this problem. The motivation behind our work was that optimizing tool replacement operations may produce a significant improvement in manufacturing efficiency and competitiveness. It is known that changing tools at the right moment is essential,not only because of the cost of cutting tools themselves, but also for the indirect costs due to the unproductive time needed to carry out the tool replacement. This thesis addresses the task of tool wear monitoring in edge profile milling processes using computer vision and machine learning techniques allowing to replace the tools at the optimum moment and thus saving direct and indirect costs.

We have created three insert datasets to assess our solutions in similar conditions to the real environment: Insert edges dataset, Insert region dataset, and Insert High-Resolution Dataset. The general shape can be extract from the boundary pixels of an image. For this reason, our first proposal for shape description was a contour-based approach. We proposed RCPDH and CPDH36R, both based on CPDH (Contour points distribution histogram). Next, we decided to describe the images using both moments and orientations. We introduced two new methods named aZIBO and B-ORCHIZ, both of them based on ZMEG approach. They are composed for global and local shape descriptors. The combination of local and global descriptors allows us to have an idea of the general form and to access the local details of the form. In this way, we take advantage of both methods of description. B-ORCHIZ proved to be the best moment-orientation descriptor obtaining an accuracy up to 91.92\% in the shape description problem. Results were promising not only for generic shape datasets but also in real applications obtaining results up to 87.02\% in terms of accuracy in the tool wear monitoring problem. As B-ORCHIZ descriptor proved to be useful in the tool wear monitoring field, we explored the combination of it with our shape descriptor proposal, ShapeFeat. ShapeFeat takes into account ten different features extracted from the binary region of each image. Combining ShapeFeat with B-ORCHIZ and evaluating three types of fusion methods, we obtained results which improves the performance significantly, yielding a 91.44\% of hit rate in the complete dataset evaluation using two classes and a 82.90\% using three classes. Our final proposal consisted of a new online, low cost and fast approach to determine the state and categorize the wear of cutting tools used in edge profile milling processes. The method proposed is based on dividing the region of the cutting edge in patches. We presented five alternatives to carry out this division and we described each patch with different texture methods. The experiments were carried out using a Support Vector Machine (SVM) with intersection kernel. Results shown that our proposal ”Small Edge Division” (SED) outperforms the other region division proposals achieving an Fscore value of 0.9032.},

  abstract   = {Every industry is now turning towards industry 4.0. In this era, industry requires smart machine tools. But for small scale and medium scale industries, it is not affordable to buy new smart machineries. Therefore, the fault diagnosis system (FDS) has got unavoidable propensity in the machine of modern huge information and smart manufacturing. Simultaneously, it offers a solid answer for taking care of the mechanical machines \& its cutting tools health status. Industry 4.0 and its key advances assume a fundamental part to make mechanical systems independent and along these lines make conceivable the automated data assortment from modern machines/cutting tools. In view of the gathered information, ML algorithms can be applied for automated shortcoming identification and finding. It is difficult to choose relevant machine learning (ML) procedures, kind of data, data size, and hardware to apply ML in mechanical systems. Determination of wrong FDS procedure, dataset, and data size may cause increase in downtime and infeasible for scheduled maintenance. Accordingly, this study aims to present, the brief review of literatures for investigation to find existing methodologies of ML and its applications, Supportability to develop novel system to diagnose faults in CNC hobbing cutter and to choose suitable ML methods for their required FDS.},

  abstract   = {Machine Learning (ML) is a branch of artificial intelligence that studies algorithms able to learn autonomously, directly from the input data. Over the last decade, ML techniques have made a huge leap forward, as demonstrated by Deep Learning (DL) algorithms implemented by autonomous driving cars, or by electronic strategy games. Hence, researchers have started to consider ML also for applications within the industrial field, and many works indicate ML as one the main enablers to evolve a traditional manufacturing system up to the Industry 4.0 level. Nonetheless, industrial applications are still few and limited to a small cluster of international companies. This paper deals with these topics, intending to clarify the real potentialities, as well as potential flaws, of ML algorithms applied to operation management. A comprehensive review is presented and organized in a way that should facilitate the orientation of practitioners in this field. To this aim, papers from 2000 to date are categorized in terms of the applied algorithm and application domain, and a keyword analysis is also performed, to details the most promising topics in the field. What emerges is a consistent upward trend in the number of publications, with a spike of interest for unsupervised and especially deep learning techniques, which recorded a very high number of publications in the last five years. Concerning trends, along with consolidated research areas, recent topics that are growing in popularity were also discovered. Among these, the main ones are production planning and control and defect analysis, thus suggesting that in the years to come ML will become pervasive in many fields of operation management.},

  abstract   = {During the last years, notable efforts have been made to develop reliable and industrially applicable machining monitoring systems based on different types of sensors, especially indirect methods that do not require the interruption of the machining process. As the main objective in machining processes is to produce a high-quality surface finish which, however, can be measured only at the end of the machining cycle, a more preferable method would be to monitor the quality during the cycle. Motivated by that premise,do not interrupt the machining process, results of investigation on the relationship between audible sound emitted during process and the resulted surface finish are reported in this paper. Through experiments with AISI 52100 hardened steel, this paper shows that such a correlation does exist between the surface roughness and the sound energy, and based on that correlation, a new quality monitoring method is proposed using Support Vector Machines (SVM) approached by the Principal Component Analysis (PCA). Obtained results shown that this method can identify three different levels of surface roughness achieving an average accuracy of 100.00\%.},
  comment    = {- Technical paper. 
- Surface roughness classification, based on acoustic signals during cutting. 
- Use STFT followed by PCA per coefficients, and SVM for classification.
- Tested on CNC, with stock microphone
- Some complicated experimental machining setups, several parameters in the process (rotating speed, feed rate).
- Results weak. Some PCA coeffs are correlated with roughness, and can be clustered consistently into 3 groups, which can then be identified in test sets. - More investigative / basic research, no clear results.},

Performance of the developed system is compared to the results from an alternative detection system based on a multiple linear regression model.

Current fault diagnosis approaches mostly depend on expert-designed features for building prediction models. In this paper, we proposed IDSCNN, a novel bearing fault diagnosis algorithm based on ensemble deep convolutional neural networks and an improved Dempster–Shafer theory based evidence fusion. The convolutional neural networks take the root mean square (RMS) maps from the FFT (Fast Fourier Transformation) features of the vibration signals from two sensors as inputs. The improved D-S evidence theory is implemented via distance matrix from evidences and modified Gini Index. Extensive evaluations of the IDSCNN on the Case Western Reserve Dataset showed that our IDSCNN algorithm can achieve better fault diagnosis performance than existing machine learning methods by fusing complementary or conflicting evidences from different models and sensors and adapting to different load conditions.},
