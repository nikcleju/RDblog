## Claim

For testing, I think we should replace $I$ with
$\tilde{\gamma} = K^{-1} k$, i.e the expansion of $k$ in the basis $K$.

## Justification

The justification follows the same lines as Kernel DL.

The starting problem we want to solve is:

$$\arg\min_{\tilde{x}} \|\varphi(\tilde{y}) - \varphi(D) \tilde{x}\|_2$${#eq-1}

where $\varphi$ is the feature map and $\tilde{y}$ test point
(let's assume it's a single vector).

Kernel DL restricts $\varphi(D)$ to be in the span of $\varphi(Y)$,
i.e. $\varphi(D) = \varphi(Y) A$ for some A (that is learned), so we have:

$$\arg\min_{\tilde{x}} \|\varphi(\tilde{y}) - \varphi(Y) A \tilde{x}\|_2$$

Part of $\varphi(\tilde{y})$ lies is in the span of $\varphi(Y)$ and
another part is orthogonal to it, and it is clear that only the
component in the span of $\varphi(Y)$ can ever be minimized with atoms $\varphi(Y)$,
so without loss of generality we can state the problem (@eq-1) as:

$$\arg\min_{\tilde{x}} \|\varphi(Y) \tilde{\gamma} - \varphi(Y) A \tilde{x}\|_2$${#eq-2}

where $\varphi(Y)\tilde{\gamma}$ is the orthogonal projection
of $\varphi(\tilde{y})$ onto the span of $\varphi(Y)$:

$$\tilde{\gamma} = \arg\min_{\gamma} \|\varphi(\tilde{y}) - \varphi(Y) \gamma\|_2$${#eq-3}

With this change, the problem (@eq-2) becomes similar to the Kernel DL problem:

$$\arg\min_{\tilde{x}} \|\varphi(Y) \left( \tilde{\gamma} - A \tilde{x} \right) \|_2$${#eq-4}

and the algorithm tries to minimize the right-hand paranthesis $(\tilde{\gamma} - A \tilde{x})$.
Thus, $\tilde{\gamma}$ is replacing $I$ from the training.

Now, coming back at $\tilde{\gamma}$, this is the least-squares solution
to the problem (@eq-3):
$$\begin{align}
\tilde{\gamma} &= \arg\min_{\gamma} \|\varphi(\tilde{y}) - \varphi(Y) \gamma\|_2 \\
&\overset{(a)}{=} \left( \varphi(Y)^T \varphi(Y) \right)^{-1} \varphi(Y)^T \varphi(\tilde{y}) \\
&= K^{-1} k
\end{align}$${#eq-5}
where $(a)$ is because $\varphi(Y)$ is a tall matrix.

Observe that $\tilde{\gamma}= K^{-1} k$ is just the basis expansion of $k$ in $K$,
$$k = K \tilde{\gamma}$$

QED.
